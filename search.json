You should do this on the machine that you want to use for writing your blog, in my case my Macbook laptop.\nOnce installed you will have access to the quarto Command Line Interface (CLI). To make sure everything works as expected, open a terminal and execute:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto --help\n\nThis should render some outputs describing the different commands and options that are part of the Quarto CLI and shows that Quarto is installed successfully."

    "text": "Step 2: create a GitHub repo\nTo host our blog, we will use GitHub Pages, which is a service to host a website from a GitHub repository. Based on the name you pick for your repository you will create a so-called project-website or your unique user-website. For any general repo named my-awesome-repo, the website will be hosted on https://<github-username>.github.io/my-awesome-repo. This is a project-websites and you can create as many as you like.\nTo create your user-website, you have to name the repo exactly like this: <github-username>.github.io, the user-website will be hosted at https://<github-username>.github.io.\nSince I want my blog to be hosted as my user-website, I thus create a new repo with the name: lucasvw.github.io.\nI find it helpful to add a .gitignore file with a Python template, to which we can later add some more entries to facilitate storing the right files on GitHub. Also make sure that the repo is Public (and not set to Private). Additionally, I added a README file and choose the Apache2 License.\nNext, I clone this repo to my machine by running the following command:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit clone git@github.com:lucasvw/lucasvw.github.io.git"

Then access the VS Code terminal and run:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto create-project --type website:blog\n\nThis will add a number of files to our repo, which represent the basic structure of our blog. Most importantly:\n\nposts: here we will create our blog entries (one subfolder per blog entry)\n_quarto.yml: configuration file for our blog such as the theme, name, GitHub and Twitter links\nabout.qmd: source code for the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page.\nindex.qmd: source code for the landing page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n.qmd files are like markdown files, but with lots of additional functionality from Quarto. Go here for more information on Markdown syntax and here for Quarto Markdown\n\n\nTo see what we currently have, let‚Äôs render our blog locally. We can do this by running\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto preview\n\nAlternatively, we can install the Quarto extension in VS Code, which will show a render button in the top right corner on any opened qmd file.\nTo publish the current contents to GitHub pages, we can run:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages\n\nWhen we run this, we get a message that we have to change the branch from which GitHub Pages builds the site. To do this, I go to https://github.com/lucasvw/lucasvw.github.io/settings/pages and select gh-pages instead of the main branch.\nAnd voila, in a few moments our blog will be running live at https://lucasvw.github.io/"

    "text": "Step 4: Finalize set-up\nWhen we run the quarto publish gh-pages command, Quarto processes our files and turns them into web readable files (HTML, JS, CSS etc). It stores these files in our gh-pages branch and pushes them to our remote GitHub repo. This is great, but it means that this doesn‚Äôt store our source files.\nTo do so, let‚Äôs first open our .gitignore file and make sure that it contains the following entries so that we don‚Äôt check in any files we don‚Äôt need.\n\n\n.gitignore\n\n# Quarto\n/.quarto/\n_site/\n\n# Mac files\n.DS_Store\n\nNext, we can commit all the remaining files to Git and push them to our remote repo. If we ever lose access to our local machine, we can restore everything we need from GitHub.\nHowever, now we have 2 things we need to do whenever we finish our work:\n\nstore our source files on the main branch and push to GitHub\nrun the publish command to update the blog\n\nThis is a bit annoying and it would be much better if we can just push to the main branch and GitHub would take care of building our website and updating it. So let‚Äôs use GitHub actions for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBefore you continue make sure you have at least once run a quarto publish gh-pages command, this is necessary for the things below to work\n\n\nFirst we need to add the following snippet to _quarto.yml\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto\n\nThis will make sure that GitHub actions doesn‚Äôt execute any executable code, but will show the pre-rendered outputs it finds in the _freeze folder.\nFinally, create the file .github/workflows/publish.yml and populate it with the following code:\n\n\n.github/workflows/publish.yml\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\nOnce we push these things to GitHub, we are good to go. Whenever we push anything to the main branch, this workflow will execute and take care of updating the gh-pages branch and updating the blog."
