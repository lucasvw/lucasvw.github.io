You should do this on the machine that you want to use for writing your blog, in my case my Macbook laptop.\nOnce installed you will have access to the quarto Command Line Interface (CLI). To make sure everything works as expected, open a terminal and execute:\nquarto --help\nThis should give some outputs describing the different commands and options that are part of the Quarto CLI and shows that Quarto is installed successfully."

Based on the name you pick for your repository you will create a so-called ‚Äúproject website‚Äù or your unique ‚Äúuser website‚Äù. For any repo named my-awesome-repo, the website will be hosted on https://<github-username>.github.io/my-awesome-repo, this is what‚Äôs called a project website and you can create as many as you like.\nYou can create your ‚Äúuser website‚Äù by creating a repo called <github-username>.github.io, which will be hosted at https://<github-username>.github.io.\nSince I want my blog to be hosted as ‚Äúuser website‚Äù, I thus create a new repo with the name: lucasvw.github.io.\nI find it helpful to add a .gitignore file with a Python template, to which we can later add some more entries to facilitate storing the right files on GitHub. Also make sure that the repo is Public (and not set to Private). Additionally, I added a README file and choose the Apache2 License.\nNext, I clone this repo to my machine by running the following command in the folder where I have all my code project.\ngit clone git@github.com:lucasvw/lucasvw.github.io.git"

Most importantly:\n\nposts: here we will create our blog entries (one subfolder per blog entry)\n_quarto.yml: configuration file for our blog such as the theme, name, GitHub and Twitter links\nabout.qmd: source code for the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page.\nindex.qmd: source code for the landing page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n.qmd files are like markdown files, but with lots of additional functionality from Quarto. Go here for more information on Markdown syntax and here for Quarto Markdown\n\n\nTo see what we currently have, let‚Äôs render our blog locally. We can do this by running\nquarto preview\nAlternatively, we can install the Quarto extension in VS Code, which will show a render button in the top right corner on any opened qmd file.\nTo publish to GitHub pages, we can run:\nquarto publish gh-pages\nWhen we run this, we get a message that we have to change the branch from which GitHub Pages builds the site. To do this, I go to https://github.com/lucasvw/lucasvw.github.io/settings/pages and select gh-pages instead of the main branch.\nAnd voila, in a few moments our blog will be running live at https://lucasvw.github.io/"
