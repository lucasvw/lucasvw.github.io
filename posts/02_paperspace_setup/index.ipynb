    "Most people don't have a GPU that is suited for Deep Learning installed in their working machine, and in fact you don't need to. It's quite easy to setup a remote GPU server nowadays, and in this blog I will explain how to do so with [Paperspace Gradient](https://www.paperspace.com/gradient). \n",
    "\n",
    "I started using Paperspace because of a recommendation from Jeremy Howard in his [Live Coding Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM). If you haven't seen these lectures, I can highly recommend them. They are a great resource on many things related to getting started with Deep Learning, especially he shows a lot of productivity hacks and practical tips on getting a good setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Paperspace setup explanations are a bit out-dated which can lead to confusion when following along with the video's. This blog will hopefully help others to navigate this and quickly set-up a remote GPU server. I would advice anybody who wants to try Paperspace, to first watch the videos from Jeremy to have a general idea of how it works, and then follow these steps to quickly get set-up."

I personally signed up for the pro-plan, which has a very good value for money. You get 15Gb persistent storage and free Mid instance types. If available, I use the A4000, which is the fastest and comes with 16GB of GPU memory.\n",

However, Paperspace comes with two special folders that are persisted. It's important to understand how these folder works, since we obviously need to persist our work. Besides that, we would also like to persist configuration files from GitHub, Kaggle, HuggingFace or any other service we are interacting with.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the first few videos, Jeremy shows a lot of tricks on how to install new packages and set up Git. After the recording of these videos, he made a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fastai/paperspace-setup) which facilitates this setup greatly and makes most of the steps from the videos unnecessary. So let's use that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{.bash filename='Terminal' .code-overflow-wrap}\n",

    "> cd paperspace-setup\n",
    "> ./setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what this does, let's have a look at `setup.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{.bash filename='setup.py' .code-overflow-wrap}\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env bash\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",

    "#### **pre-run.sh**\n",
    "\n",
    "Paperspace automatically executes `/storage/pre-run.sh` during startup of our Notebook Server (upon creation or restart). This is great, because we can use this to automate our setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look [here](https://github.com/fastai/paperspace-setup/blob/master/pre-run.sh) for the full script. Let's have a closer look at this snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{.bash filename='pre-run.sh (snippet)' .code-overflow-wrap}\n",
    "for p in .local .ssh .config .ipython .fastai .jupyter .conda .kaggle\n",
    "do\n",
    "        if [ ! -e /storage/cfg/$p ]; then\n",
    "                mkdir /storage/cfg/$p\n",
    "        fi\n",
    "        rm -rf ~/$p\n",
    "        ln -s /storage/cfg/$p ~/\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So for any of these folder names(`.local .ssh ...`) we are creating a directory inside of `/storage/cfg` if it doesn't exist. Also, each of these folders is symlinked to the home directory (`~`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) When we store something in any of these symlinked folders (e.g. `~/.local`), it's actually being written to the associated storage folder (e.g. `/storage/cfg/.local`).\n",
    "2) Whenever we restart our Notebook Server, all the things that have been previously been persisted (e.g. in `/storage/cfg/.local`) are available again in the home directory (e.g. `~/.local`).\n",
    "\n",
    "And as it turns out, many tools we want to use keep their configuration files in this home folder. So by persisting this data, we will ensure they work across restarts of our Notebook servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **.local**\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw before that the FastAI runtime comes with a number of installed Python packages. If we want to install additional packages, we could do: `pip install <package>`. Pip installs the packages in `/usr/local/lib`, and are thus not persisted. Since it's very annoying to install all our additional packages upon restart, we can install with `pip install --user <package>`. This installs the package only for the user in the `~/.local` directory, and as we have seen this folder is persisted!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **.ssh**\n",
    "\n",
    "To authenticate with GitHub without using passwords, we use ssh keys. We can create them by running `ssh-keygen`, which adds the private key (`id_rsa`) and the public file (`id_rsa.pub`) to the `~/.ssh` folder. Once we upload the public key to GitHub we have continuous authentication with GitHub, since this folder is also persisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you probably get the idea, any of these folders represent a certain configuration we want to persist:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.conda`: contains conda/mamba installed packages\n",
    "- `.kaggle`: contains a `kaggle.json` authentication file\n",
    "- `.fastai`: contains downloaded datasets\n",
    "-  `.config`, `.ipython` and `.jupyter`: contain config files\n",
    "\n",
    "I also added `.huggingface` to this list, to make sure my HuggingFace credentials are also persisted. See [here](https://github.com/fastai/paperspace-setup/pull/4) for the PR into the main repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the script we do exactly the same thing, but for a number of files instead of directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{.bash filename='pre-run.sh (snippet)' .code-overflow-wrap}\n",
    "for p in .git-credentials .gitconfig .bash_history\n",
    "do\n",
    "        if [ ! -e /storage/cfg/$p ]; then\n",

    "\n",
    "### Note on Mamba\n",
    "At this point you might wonder why we have the Mamba installation at all, since we have seen that the system Python is used. In fact, our Mamba environment is totally decoupled from what we are using in our Jupyter notebook, and installing packages through `mamba` will not make them available to our Jupyter Notebook environment. Instead, we should install Python packages with `pip` (or `pipi`)\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess Jeremy has done this to be able to install none-Python specific packages that he wants to use from the Terminal. For example, in the videos he talks about `ctags` which he installs through `mamba`. So it functions as a general package manager, somewhat similar to `apt-get`. "
