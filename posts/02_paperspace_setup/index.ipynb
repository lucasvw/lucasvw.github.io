    "Most people don't have a GPU that is suited for Deep Learning installed in their working machine, and in fact you don't need to. It's quite easy to setup a remote GPU server nowadays, and in this blog I will explain how to do so with Paperspace Gradient. \n",

    "If you haven't seen these lectures, I can highly recommend them. They are a great resource on many things related to getting started with Deep Learning, especially a lot of productivity hacks and practical tips on getting a good setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Paperspace setup explanations are a bit out-dated which can lead to confusion when following along with the video's. This blog will hopefully help others to navigate this and quickly set-up a remote GPU server. I would advice anybody who wants to try Paperspace, to first watch the videos from Jeremy to have a general idea of how it works, and then follow these steps to quickly get set-up."

    "So for a list of strings (`.local .ssh ...`), we are creating a directory inside of our `/storage/cfg` folder if it doesn't exist, and then symlinks are created to the home directory (`~`).\n",

    "This means that:\n",
    "- Whenever something is stored during a session in any of these symlinked folders (e.g. `~/.local`), this is actually stored in the associated storage folder (e.g. `/storage/cfg/.local`). All this is thus persisted!\n",

    "Before we saw that the FastAI runtime comes with a number of installed Python packages. If we want to install new packages, we could do: `pip install <package>`. This installs the packages in `/usr/local/lib`, so this is not persisted and would mean that every time we restart the Notebook Server we would have to reinstall the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can install the package in a different location with `pip install -U <package>`. This installs the package only for the user in the `~/.local` directory, and as we have seen this folder is persisted!\n",

    "### .ssh\n",
    "\n",
    "To authenticate with GitHub without using passwords, we use GitHub ssh keys. We can create them by running `ssh-keygen`. This creates by default two files in `~/.ssh`, the private key (`id_rsa`) and the public file (`id_rsa.pub`). We need to upload the public key to GitHub and we need to keep the private key in the `~/.ssh` folder. Since this folder is now persisted, we can authenticate with GitHub across restarts!\n",

I guess Jeremy has done this to be able to install none-Python specific packages that he wants to use from the Terminal. For example, in the videos he talks about `ctags` which he installs through `mamba`. So it functions as a general package manager, somewhat similar to `apt-get`.\n",
