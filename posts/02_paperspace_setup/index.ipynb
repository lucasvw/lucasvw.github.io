    "Most people don't have a GPU installed in their working machine that is suited for Deep Learning, and in fact you don't need to. It's quite easy to setup a remote GPU server nowadays, and in this blog I will explain how to do so with [Paperspace Gradient](https://www.paperspace.com/gradient). \n",
    "\n",
    "I started using Paperspace because of a recommendation from Jeremy Howard in his [Live Coding Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM). If you haven't seen these lectures, I can highly recommend them. They are a great resource on many things related to getting started with Deep Learning. Jeremy shows a lot of productivity hacks and practical tips on getting a good setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Paperspace setup explanations are a bit out-dated which can lead to confusion when following along with the video's. Also, after the recording of the videos Jeremy created some nice scripts which simplify the setup. This blog will hopefully help others to navigate this and quickly set-up a remote GPU server. I would advice anybody who wants to try Paperspace, to first watch the videos from Jeremy to have a general idea of how it works, and then follow these steps to quickly get set-up."

After the recording of these videos, he made a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fastai/paperspace-setup) which facilitates this setup greatly and makes most of the steps from the videos unnecessary. So let's use that:\n",

    "#### **pre-run.sh**\n",
    "\n",
    "During startup of a Notebook Server (upon creation or restart), Paperspace automatically executes the script it finds at `/storage/pre-run.sh`. This is really neat, since we can create a script at this location to automate our setup!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the full script, click [here](https://github.com/fastai/paperspace-setup/blob/master/pre-run.sh), and let's have a closer look at this first snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{.bash filename='pre-run.sh (snippet)' .code-overflow-wrap code-line-numbers=\"true\"}\n",
    "for p in .local .ssh .config .ipython .fastai .jupyter .conda .kaggle\n",
    "do\n",
    "        if [ ! -e /storage/cfg/$p ]; then\n",
    "                mkdir /storage/cfg/$p\n",
    "        fi\n",
    "        rm -rf ~/$p\n",
    "        ln -s /storage/cfg/$p ~/\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we are iterating through a list of folder names (`.local .ssh ...`) on line 1, and for each one we create a directory inside of `/storage/cfg` on line 4. We only do this if the directory doesn't already exist on line 3. Next, each of these folders is symlinked to the home directory (`~/`) on line 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) When we store something in any of these symlinked folders (e.g. `~/.local`), it's actually being written to the associated storage folder (e.g. `/storage/cfg/.local`) because of the symlink.\n",
    "2) Whenever we restart our Notebook Server, all the stuff that has previously been persisted (e.g. in `/storage/cfg/.local`) are made available again in the home directory (e.g. `~/.local`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very nice, because as it turns out: many tools keep their configuration files in this home folder. So by persisting this data, they will keep working across restarts of our Notebook servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's a closer look at the folders we are persisting:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **.local**\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw before that the FastAI runtime comes with a number of installed Python packages. If we want to install additional packages, we could do: `pip install <package>`. However, pip installs the packages in `/usr/local/lib`, and are thus not persisted. To make sure our packages are persisted, we can instead install with `pip install --user <package>`. This `--user` flag, tells `pip` to install the package only for the current user, and so it installs into the `~/.local` directory. So by persisting this folder, we make sure that we our custom installed python packages are persisted, awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **.ssh**\n",
    "\n",
    "To authenticate with GitHub without using passwords, we use ssh keys. To create a pair of keys, we run: `ssh-keygen`. This creates the private key (`id_rsa`) and the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to the `~/.ssh` folder. Once we upload the public key to GitHub we can authenticate with GitHub, and by persisting this folder we can authenticate upon restart!\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you probably get the idea, any of these folders represent a certain configuration we want to persist:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.conda`: contains conda/mamba installed packages\n",
    "- `.kaggle`: contains a `kaggle.json` authentication file\n",
    "- `.fastai`: contains downloaded datasets and some other configuration\n",
    "-  `.config`, `.ipython` and `.jupyter`: contain config files for various pieces of software such as matplotlib, ipython and jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally also added `.huggingface` to this list, to make sure my HuggingFace credentials are also persisted. See [here](https://github.com/fastai/paperspace-setup/pull/4) for the PR back into the main repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the script we do exactly the same thing, but for a number of files instead of directories. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{.bash filename='pre-run.sh (snippet)' .code-overflow-wrap}\n",
    "for p in .git-credentials .gitconfig .bash_history\n",
    "do\n",
    "        if [ ! -e /storage/cfg/$p ]; then\n",

    "\n",
    "### Note on Mamba\n",
    "At this point you might wonder why we have the Mamba installation at all, since we have seen that the system Python is used. In fact, our Mamba environment is totally decoupled from what we are using in our Jupyter notebook, and installing packages through `mamba` will **not make them available in Jupyter**. Instead, we should install Python packages through `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we need Mamba for? I guess Jeremy has done this to be able to install binaries that he wants to use from the Terminal. For example, in the videos he talks about `ctags` which he installs through `mamba`. Since installing none-Python specific binaries through pip can be complicated, we can use Mamba instead. In other words, we can use it as a general package manager, somewhat similar to `apt-get`. "
