    "To host our blog, we will use GitHub Pages, which is a service to host a website from a GitHub repository. Based on the name you pick for your repository you will create a so-called \"project website\" or your unique \"user website\". For any repo named `my-awesome-repo`, the website will be hosted on `https://<github-username>.github.io/my-awesome-repo`, this is what's called a project website and you can create as many as you like. \n",

    "- `index.qmd`: source code for the landing page.\n",
