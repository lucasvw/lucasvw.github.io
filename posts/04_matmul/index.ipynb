    "Matrix multiplications are kind of boring, so why write a blog post about them? Well, matrix multiplications are the most basic computation that is being performed by neural networks. So it's probably good to be familiar with them, eventhough we never do them by hand. Also, we are going to focus on vectorization to speed them up. Vectorization is something we often have to do, to make sure everything runs as quickly as possible, and it's thus a good exercise to understand how to achieve this. Especially since it involves being very familiar with matrices, their shapes, broadcasting operations and the like.\n",

    "Matrix multiplication is not difficult, it goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For matrix A of size `[ar x ac]` &nbsp; (`[4 x 3]` in the image below)\n",
    "- and matrix B of size `[br x bc]` &nbsp; (`[3 x 2]` in the image below)\n",
    "- the matrix product `A * B` is of size `[ar x bc]` (`[4 x 2]` in the image below).\n",
    "- So the matrix product is thus only defined when `ac == br` (`3 == 3` in the image below)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](image.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "So for any valid matrix multiplication, we have three dimensions that need to considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ar`: the row dimension of matrix A. The size of this dimension will become the size of the row dimension of the output matrix (black arrow in the image above)\n",
    "- `bc`: the column dimension of matrix B. The size of this dimension will become the size of the column dimension of the output matrix (purple arrow in the image above)\n",
    "- `ac`: the column dimension of Matrix A and `br`: the row dimension of matrix B: **they need to be equal** (red arrow in the image above)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do `ac` and `bc` need to be equal? Well, because we take the inner product over this dimension when computing the cell values of the new matrix, and inner-products are only defined for vectors of equal length. Below, I will also refer to this dimension as the dimension over which we collapse (or the \"collapsible\" dimension), since in the output matrix, this dimension is no longer present.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](image1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, to compute cell $C_{i,j}$ we take the inner product between row `i` of matrix A and column `j` of matrix B. If we take for example the inner product between row 3 of matrix A and column 2 of matrix B we get the value of cell $C_{3,2}$:\n",

    "For the final improvement, we need to get rid of the only remaining loop over the rows of our output matrix (`i`). So let's understand very well what we are having at the moment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are iterating over the (4) rows of our output matrix\n",
    "- For each row, we are computing the (2) values of our row at once by doing `out[i, :] = (a[i, :].unsqueeze(-1) * b).sum(dim=0)` and let's break this down once again in steps:\n",
    "  1. `a[i, :]` has shape `[3]` and represents one row of A\n",
    "  2. with `a[i, :].unsqueeze(-1)` we add an extra dimension so that we can broadcast, the result has shape `[3, 1]`\n",
    "  3. `b` has shape `[3, 2]` and is the full B matrix\n",
    "  4. element-wise multiplication of 2. and 3. gives a matrix of shape `[3, 2]`\n",
    "  5. by summing over the rows (`.sum(dim=0)`) we arrive at the result of shape `[2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to improve this by **instead of iterating over the 4 rows, do these computations all at once for all rows**. So let's start by not selecting one row of A (`a[i,:]`) but instead just the whole `a` matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `a` has shape `[4, 3]`\n",
    "2. similarly to what we did before, we can `a.unsqueeze(-1)` to add an extra dimension, the result has shape `[4, 3, 1]`\n",
    "3. same as before, `b` has shape `[3, 2]` and is the full B matrix\n",
    "4. broadcasting of 2. and 3. will do the following:\n",
    "   - `a.unsqueeze(-1)` has shape `[4, 3, 1]` and get's expanded to `[4, 3, 2]` to match the shape of `b` (`[3, 2]`)\n",
    "   - but `b` also needs to match `a`, first an additional empty dimension is added in the front: `[1, 3, 2]` and then it get's expanded to `[4, 3, 2]`\n",
    "   - Thus, the element-wise multiplication of 2. and 3. gives a matrix (tensor) of shape `[4, 3, 2]`, let's call it `t`. It's import to realize what this `t` represents. For that, notice that the first dimension (length 4) and last dimension (length 2) are the dimensions of our output matrix (`[4, 2]`). **The middle dimension (length 3) represents the element wise multiplications of row i in matrix A and column j of matrix B**. So `t[0, :, 0]` gives us 3 numbers which represent the element-wise multiplications of the first row of A and the first column of B.\n",
